# Libtorch_Colab
The point of this repository is to write a few well known network architectures using `libtorch`. This helps me with to use some of the teachings from the course "Modern C++" (c++17 and c++20). 
Here is a list of TODOS: 

- [ ] Training routines
  - [ ] Saving
  - [ ] Restart
  - [ ] Early Stop
- [ ] Datasets
  - [ ] Fashion-MNIST
  - [ ] CIFAR10
- [ ] Networks
  - [ ] Inception
  - [ ] ResNet
  - [ ] DenseNet
  - [ ] Transformer
